      <ArticleSectionTitle>Diehard Tests</ArticleSectionTitle>
      <p>
        George Marsaglia was the most prolific researcher of random number
        generators in the 1990s. He created the "diehard tests" which served as
        the basis for most research going forward. If you can't tell by the name
        of the tests (probably a reference to the movie "Die Hard"), Dr.
        Marsaglia was a bit of a memer.

      <p>
        Donald Knuth appears to have published some of the earliest work on
        random number generation testing, at least since computers were first
        developed. However, since Knuth has updated his books throughout the
        years, the timeline of developments is not clear at a glance.
        Nevertheless, the current version dives very deep on the theoretical
        math behind each test.

        It would be interesting to show the results of randomness tests on
        mathematical constants like <InlineMath math="\pi" />,{" "}
        <InlineMath math="e" />, and <InlineMath math="\sqrt{2}" />. There is no
        theoretical proof that their digits behave randomly, but it would be fun
        to confirm this experimentally.
