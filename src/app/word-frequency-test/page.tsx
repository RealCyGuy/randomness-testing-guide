      <p>Let's say we have the following binary string.</p>
      <BlockMath math="s = \color{lightcoral}{01010101}\color{lightgreen}{00110011}\color{lightblue}{000111}\color{lightcoral}{01010101}\color{lightgreen}{00110011}\color{lightblue}{000111}\color{orchid}{00001111}" />
      <p>
        It is obviously not random because it is a concatenation of
        predetermined bit sequences. Therefore, we must check that the same
        groups of bits are not repeated too often.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can use the frequency of "words" to determine if certain bit groups
        occur too often. There are four possible 2-bit words: 00, 01, 10, and
        11. If we assign A, B, C, and D to these words, respectively, then the
        sequence above transforms into the following sequence.
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="s = \color{lightcoral}{BBBB}\color{lightgreen}{ADAD}\color{lightblue}{ABD}\color{lightcoral}{BBBB}\color{lightgreen}{ADAD}\color{lightblue}{ABD}\color{orchid}{AADD}" />
      <p>
        Now we can run a frequency test on this string with four categories.
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="\chi^{2}_{3} = \frac{(8 - 6.5)^2}{6.5} + \frac{(10 - 6.5)^2}{6.5} + \frac{(0 - 6.5)^2}{6.5} + \frac{(8 - 6.5)^2}{6.5} \approx 9.0769" />
      <p>
        The p-value for a chi-squared of 9.0769 with 3 degrees of freedom is
        0.0000, which is less than 0.01, indicating that this sequence of
        numbers was probably not randomly generated.

      <p>
        This sequence isn't quite long enough to see that it's not random, but a
        longer version of the same sequence does fail the test.

      <p>
        This test, known as the <b>word frequency test</b>, is a significantly
        more difficult to pass than the runs test. Instead of concatenating
        predetermined strings, we must use a mathematical process that has
        seemingly random behavior. One very simple off-the-shelf method for
        doing this is using a <b>linear congruential generator</b>, which is
        defined by the following formula.
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="X_{n+1} = (aX_n + c) \bmod m" />
      <p>
        In this formula, <InlineMath math="X_n" /> is the current value in the
        sequence, <InlineMath math="a" /> is the multiplier,{" "}
        <InlineMath math="c" /> is the increment, and <InlineMath math="m" /> is
        the modulus. <InlineMath math="X_0" /> is a seed that can be arbitrarily
        chosen. The word frequency test fails to detect output from a linear
        congruential generator.

      <p>
        The word frequency test can give very different results depending on the
        block size chosen. Larger block sizes don't always result in smaller
        p-values.
